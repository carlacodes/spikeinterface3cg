# spikeinterface3cg
Sandbox code for implementing a robust automatic spike sorting pipeline based on Jules Lebert's spikeinterface forked repo
<br> DO NOT use any important directories for spike sorting output as this WILL be overwritten.
<br> Please note this repo was made for implementing the pipeline on UCL's myriad cluster. Mountainsort4 should be on a CPU runtime, Kilsort on a CPU+GPU runtime.
